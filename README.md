## Overview
The Artwalk Corpus is a collection of mobile-to-Skype conversations between friend and stranger dyads performing a real world-situated task. This task is a hybrid of two traditional lab tasks, where participants are directed to a location (map task, e.g. Anderson et al., 1991) and find a target object from a variety of objects (tangram task, e.g. Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1989). Artwalk captures how conversation sounds when one partner has to walk, talk and navigate everyday obstacles in a small city environment, such as cars and pedestrians.

## Data
Corpus consists of transcripts of 24 friend and 24 stranger dyads who did this two-round referential communication task. In total, it contains approximately 185,000 words and 23,000 turns, from conversations that ranged from 24 to 55 minutes. It includes referent negotiation, direction-giving and small talk (non-task talk). Additional information includes selected post-experiment questionnaire responses, participant genders, sunset times, weather conditions, photos of the targets and their coordinates.
